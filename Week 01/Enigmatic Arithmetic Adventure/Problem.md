# Cryptic Arithmetic Series Challenge

Welcome, intrepid code sleuth! You've stumbled upon a cryptic arithmetic series encoded in the arcane language of integers and symbols. Brace yourself for a journey into the unknown as you attempt to decipher and unveil the secret sum of this mystical sequence. But beware, appearances can be deceiving!

## Puzzling Challenge:

Embark on this cryptic quest, navigate through the numerical maze, and emerge victorious by calculating the elusive sum concealed within the mystical series. The secret code might employ unconventional tactics, so keep your wits about you and be prepared for a dash of misdirection.

## Input Format

The first line holds the initial terms of the enigmatic series, presented in a sequence, seemingly random yet following a cryptic pattern. For example: `2+3+5+7+9`.
In the next line, you'll encounter two magical numbers, the first and last positions of the numbers that will dictate the inclusive boundaries of your quest to unlock the hidden sum.
