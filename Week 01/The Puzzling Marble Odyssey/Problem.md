# Enigma's Marble Collection

In the perplexing world of Enigma, Alice orchestrates an enigmatic collection of marbles. Each day, the count rises by the day's number (day 1: 1 marble, day 2: 2 marbles, and so forth).

To enhance her mathematical skills, she wanted to find the number of marbles she collected between two days, say Num1 and Num2. However, now Alice wants your help to make a Python program to automate the above task.

Your task is to create a Python program that helps Alice determine the total number of marbles collected between two specific days, Num1 and Num2.

- Note that the marble collected in days Num1 and Num2 must be included.

## Input Format
Input line one: Num1
Input line two: Num2

**Constraints:**
- Num1 < Num2

## Output Format
Total marbles collected

## Sample Input
302
948


## Sample Output
404375
